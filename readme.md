# Quantum key distribution

This project implements a simulation of satellite QKD protocols for different network topologies using various entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure schemes. The simulation compares the quantum bit error rate (QBER) of the above-mentioned protocols to assess their capabilities.

##Â Getting Started

To build the program, run `make all`. This will create an executable file `./program`, that you can run from the terminal. Please note that the program is provided as-is and is not meant to be run as a black-box without any knowledge of its underlying code.

## Disclaimer

This project was not intended to be a ready-to-use product, but a source code for a research paper. The purpose of this code is to simulate different QKD protocols for various network topologies and collect data on their performance metrics. The results obtained from this simulation will be used in a research paper to conclude the effectiveness of different QKD protocols in different network scenarios. Therefore, it is important to mention that it may not be fully optimised and could only be used for practical purposes after minor modifications. The program should be used for research purposes only and not for any commercial or military applications.

## Resources

The "Optical Properties of the Atmosphere (Third Edition)" is a data source used in this project. This data was collected by the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories containing information about the optical properties of the atmosphere. It is an unclassified report, but the data may still be subject to restrictions or regulations regarding its use. Permission may need to be obtained from the AFCRL or other relevant authorities before it can be used in other research projects.
